            A carbon offset – or carbon credit – is a reduction in greenhouse gas
            emissions to compensate for emissions made somewhere else. Credits are
            traceable, tradable and finite: When they are purchased by airline
            passengers, they are retired forever. This revenue funds activities
            that protect or restore forests, often supporting local communities
            with alternative livelihood opportunities that keep trees standing,
            and it helps fund programs to do so in perpetuity.

            learn more.

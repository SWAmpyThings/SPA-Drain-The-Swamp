            Our Mobile Boarding Pass is an electronic document that enables Customers
            to pass through security and board the aircraft just by using their
            mobile device. It is available through the Southwest App on Apple iOS
            and Android devices. If all of our Customers transitioned to using a
            Mobile Boarding Pass, we can save anywhere from 6-18 additional trees
            per day. That's over 2,000 trees every year!

            The weight of the aircraft has a direct correlation to the amount of
            fuel burned during a flight. More fuel usage equates to more CO<sub>2 </sub>
            emission into the atmosphere. We are proud of our "Two Free Checked Bags"
            policy and will continue to honor this benefit. All we ask is that when you
            are able to travel lighter consider small carry-on luggage as an option.
            We estimate that by losing a pound in weight from every plane in our fleet
            we could save 5,000 gallons of fuel per year. That's lowering CO<sub>2 </sub>
            emissions by 15,000 pounds!

            ways or in big ways, let us know how we can do better. Every idea that
